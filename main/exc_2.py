Challenge #2: Monthly revenue trend for the store
Problem Statement:
Calculate the total net revenue per month from all transactions.
Only include credit transactions.

Requirements:
Output should include:

month (e.g., '2023-01')

total_credit_amount

Sort by month in ascending order.

Use either SQL or pandas.

ðŸ”§ Optional: If you're using pandas, format transaction_date properly if it's not already a datetime.

Let me know when you're ready â€” and Iâ€™ll challenge you with something involving the products table next!
